# MP3ID3

This project requires [jdk1.8.0_72], default [Java Virtual Machine] itself is not enough.

On the 9th practical week at [CodeCool] we wrote an application that can read out [ID3] information from an [mp3] file.

We also wrote a directory scanner class, which can display the files in a directory and its subdirectories, recursively.
(Even though, my version uses a single for loop instead of recursion.)

What's more, I managed to connect these features
and my application displays ID3 information from mp3 files from a directory and its subdirectories.

Finally, [Mentor Sody] showed us how to play an mp3-file using [javax] package
(that's why we need jdk).

Thank you for watching my repository! :D
